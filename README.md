# Contra
My version of the popular video game


Title:  CONTRA
Note: This project was made for my Grade 11 Computer Science course.


How the game works


This game is a 2D side scroller. Unlike the original Contra, there will be only one character. Also, there will not be any tanks. At the beginning, the player has only three lives. The number of lives will be indicated at the top left corner of the screen. The player has to keep advancing forward and killing the enemies. The player wins when both levels are successfully completed. The character looks like this:
 
 The enemies will constantly appear and the player has to shoot them down.  The enemies look like this:
 
These enemies will not have any weapons. The player will only die if he collides with the enemy. He is also allowed to jump over the enemies. However, there will be some special enemies armed with guns. They will look like this:
 
The player keeps on moving forward until the level comes to an end. Then, there will be a robot like thing that will be shooting bullets constantly. The player has to kill it and move forward. Here, the player will come across a dragon. Ultimately, the player has to avoid bullets from the dragon and eventually kill it.


Modes

There will be an easy, hard and evil mode. The player is allowed to choose any mode he wishes. The default mode will be easy. As the mode gets harder, the velocity of the bullets is going to be faster. Along with that, the enemies (without weapons) will be running faster.

Levels

There will be two levels: Jungle and Snow Valley. Jungle will be the first level. If the player successfully completes Jungle, then the Snow Valley level will be loaded. The player cannot get to the second level without successfully completing the first. The game will end in two conditions:
1) The playerâ€™s number of lives reduces to zero.
		OR
2) The player successfully completes both the levels.
Characters
There will be a total of 4 characters: 
1)  The player
 


2)  Enemies without weapons
 

3)  Enemies with weapons
